                <title>Flagelo</title>
                <description>
                  Erros Alternados, a Portuguese Industrial musical project, has gathering with quite a few friends, including Kokori, and together a double album was made. Flagelo, by Erros Alternados e Amigos (Erros Alternados and Friends), has been released, both on a double CD and in digital format, the CD being in a digipak edition limited to 51 copies. The first of the discs has tracks from Erros Alternados, both new and old, and both from just the band or with them and other and their friends. The second disc contains remixes, covers, interpretations or even inspirations on Erros Alternados' extensive work, including the track &lt;a href="https://anti-demos-cracia.bandcamp.com/track/cd02-09-kokori-ir"&gt;Ir&lt;/a&gt;, from Kokori, where we cover Erros Alternados' track of the same name, under the light of Fernando Pessoa's work.

                <title>Ode Filípica Tribute</title>
                <description>
                  Kokori has always refused to see time in a linear way: time travelers of sound that we are, we see time as the dimension it is, but, as any dimension, a view from above it allows us to highlight aesthetically important cross-sections of space-time. And that is what we've recently done, by joining a few other Portuguese bands in a tribute to Ode Filípica, a post-industrial duo that were active in Portugal from 1989 to 1993, and that can be now be revisited through the lenses of eleven different ensembles, including Kokori, on a tribute album suitably entitled Misantropia. &lt;a href="https://anti-demos-cracia.bandcamp.com/track/kokori-infinito-finito"&gt;Infinito Finito&lt;/a&gt;, the work we decided to cover, is freely available for download, as well as the rest of the compilation. And if you can back in time, you might even get one of the limited edition CDs, too.

                <title>Quest For A Red Moon</title>
                <description>
                  Kokori has a new track, "Quest For A Red Moon", released in another colaboration with the Metaphysical Circuits label, this time a participation in the "I Never Metaphysical I Didn't Like" compilation. Next to projects like Cryptic Scenery, Lero, The Kirks or Counterspace, this is a metaphysical compilation with twenty eight tracks, eclectic yet cohese and coherent. On this release that marks the end of a journey for Metaphysical Circuits, Kokori sets out on a quest, in search for a red moon. As usual, it is unclear wether this quest happens in the past or in the future, but it is one that you can &lt;a href="https://metaphysicalcircuits.bandcamp.com/track/quest-for-a-red-moon"&gt;join us in&lt;/a&gt; in the present.

                <description>
                  Kokori's track "The Sky Is Concrete, The Stars Are Bullet Holes" is once released in physical format, this time in the "&lt;a href="https://cherryblossomdog.bandcamp.com/releases"&gt;Friend of the Dog&lt;/a&gt;" compilation, a gathering of different names of styles, including tracks by Læther Strip, Bubblegum Octupus or TAILZ, amongst others. Only on the physical edition of this compilation, as a bonus track, Kokori's particupation joins all these others in a CD, from which all the proceedings will be directed to Thorn and their mission to fight child pornography and sexual abuse. In a limited edition, you shouldn't skip this opportunity to enhance your record collection and help a great cause!

                <title>Kokori present on CC Mixtape</title>
                <description>
		Kokori is once again present on "Enough Records"' catalog, this time with a presence of our "The Sky Is Concrete, The Stars Are Bullet Holes" track on the ps-curated mixtape "Enough Records Mixtape for CC Europe Meeting", which, as the name says, is a mixtape made to mark the Creative Commons event that took place in Lisbon last Friday. This is a very interesting mixtape, with two parts: the first one is composed by tracks from Portuguese projects on Enough Records' catalog, with the exception of Kokori's track, that gets now released under a CC license. The second part is composed by tracks from other Portuguese netlabels during 2016.

                <title>Kokori participates in Portuguese Industrial compilation</title>
                <description>
                  Kokori has participated in "Passo a Passo", a free Portuguese Industrial compilation from the Anti-Demos-Cracia label, with the track "The Sky Is Concrete, The Stars Are Bullet Holes", taken from our album "Rootkit". It was a pleasure to be included in such a compilation, featured alongside names like Nothing: Always: Works:, Waste Disposal Machine or Teatro Grotesco, amongst others. We could spill some lines about the compilation, but, instead, why don't you just &lt;a href="http://anti-demos-cracia.bandcamp.com/album/passo-a-passo-est-ticas-sonoras"&gt;stream or download&lt;/a&gt; it? Enjoy!

                <title>Kokori announces first full-length album: Rootkit</title>
                <description>
		  Kokori is very proud to announce that the moment you all have been waiting for has finally arriving. The revolution starts with the deployment of a rootkit, and Kokori's Rootkit is finally here. That's right, Kokori has signed a deal with Artapes, and the band's first full-length album, named Rootkit, is going to hit the shelves very soon -- Monday 18th 2016, to be more precise. And because we all know how waiting can be boring, we devised a time-travelling rootkit enabler: you can already pre-order your copy, which will warrant you an insta-download! According to Artapes, Rootkit is "a dense soundscape of bleak isolationism from a nearby post-apocalyptic world. Sonority-wise, [..] voice as ‘just yet another instrument,’ and lyrics – when present – come in various formats – from actual singing to the use of various samples and voice synthesis." About half of the 13 tracks in the album are instrumental. To the followers, you'll recognize some of the tracks from previous singles/EPs, but now introduced as several functions to serve a main() purpose. Are you ready to &lt;a href="http://artapes.co.uk/product/kokori-rootkit/"&gt;deploy the Rootkit&lt;/a&gt;, and let the world of Kokori take over?

                <title>Metaphysical Circuits 3x tape compilation</title>
                <description>
				With your help, Kokori is going to be part of an awesome 3 tapes compilation. Metaphysical Circuits, a tape label from our good friend Christian of The Beard Of Snails Records (R.I.P.), is aiming to release "400/100", a three-hour, 43 track triple cassette compilation. An epic, eclectic statement, spanning ambient excursions, techno textures, slick synths, cinematic guitars, song-craft, improvisation, wyrld jamz, and no-fi noise melodies, this project has everything to be a must-have compilation, and we're proud to be a part of it with one new, exclusive track. Alongside with Kokori will be musical projects like Palm Era, TAKAHIRO MUKAI, Vejgaard Ambient, Northville Tunnels, The Child of a Creek, Stephen Connolly, Strange Mountain, cryptic scenery, Geoff, Les Bicyclettes de Belize and more. But why with your help? Well, because this endeavour needs you as much as you need it: your funding and pre-order will make it happen, and in the process you can even get some extra goodies. Find all about it on &lt;a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/metaphysical-circuits-3x-tape-compilation"&gt;its campaign page&lt;/a&gt;!

                <title>Desert Moon / First Egg</title>
                <description>
				The great and already missed The Beard Of Snails Records, the label that released Kokori's debut, has, like many good things, come to an end. But they decided not to do so in a quiet fashion, but instead with a couple of BANG!'s. The final release of this label was also the latest Kokori release, a limited edition 7 inches single, with Desert Moon on the A-side and First Egg in the B-side. Because unfortunately there are many great things that end, Kokori decided to choose two tracks for this release that were born in the womb of another great now-ended project you probably heard of, by now: The 20th. And this limited edition journey and quest through a Desert Moon to reach at the First Egg has already found its place among the record colections of an enlighted few: but fear not, for if this relic is indeed sold out, you can still experience what you've just missed: just listen to the music player on the right bar of our website. If you, like us, want to pay tribute to the life of this record label, that categorized this latest single as "Darker techwave sensibilities meet scorched Zappa cheese; the sonic importance of the vacuum cleaner; The Son of the Sheik meets Metropolis...?!", remember: the "Bearded Snails" compilation Kokori participated on is &lt;a href="http://abeardofsnails.storenvy.com/products/5204081-v-a-bearded-snails-3x-3"&gt;still on sale&lt;/a&gt;.

                <title>Kokori on vinyl: Release Candid Hate</title>
                <description>
                Just released by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/newapproachrecords"&gt;New Approach Records&lt;/a&gt;, kokori finally releases its new EP, "&lt;strong&gt;Release Candid Hate&lt;/strong&gt;". This is the harshest and yet the most beautiful kokori release to date. Following the minimalistic ambiences you've grown to love from &lt;strong&gt;make install&lt;/strong&gt;, the previous EP, Release Candid Hate joins it strong lyrics and instrumental voices. The EP, a vinyl release that comes with a digital download coupon for those of you who are afraid of needles, is available in its &lt;a href="http://newapproachrecords.tictail.com/product/kokori-release-candid-hate"&gt;standard edition&lt;/a&gt;, a 7 inches disc, or a more limited &lt;a href="http://newapproachrecords.wordpress.com/vinyl/"&gt;special edition&lt;/a&gt; of 20, that adds a transparent single-sided 5 inches vinyl to the pack.

		<title>New free() EP: make install</title>
		<description>
		Just released at &lt;a href="http://enoughrecords.scene.org/"&gt;Enough Records&lt;/a&gt;, kokori presents its new EP "make install". In the label's own words: "Portuguese industrial post-cyberpunk project kokori delivers us here an EP compiling a set of instrumental geek shaman electronic burlesque sounds with some sampling of local political activism." This EP, which you can &lt;a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/kokori/make_install/"&gt;listen or download for free&lt;/a&gt;, sums up an era, while installing the roots of great things to come.

		Like last year, at the beginning of 2013 a new compilation arrived: Each month, on the 20th of the month, a bunch of people from all kinds of places start making songs. And then they finish them, that same day! Why would they do that? It doesn't matter! The songs are great! Very often! Kokori also participated, and you can listen or download (free!) the &lt;a href="http://the20th.bandcamp.com/track/timeless"&gt;Timeless&lt;/a&gt; result!
