<p>2010 was the year for Kokori's first release, the EP "init()", and after it the band kept working on new material, participating in more than 30 compilations.</p>
<p>In July 2013 that material took form of a new digital-only EP, "make install", which you can <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/kokori/make_install/">download for free</a>.</p>
<p>This EP sums up an era, while installing the roots of great things to come...</p>
<p>...and the installation was fruitful, many bugs were fixed and the band was now ready for a <a href='https://nghproductions.limitedrun.com/products/633774-kokori-release-candid-hate-7-lathe-cut-special-edition'>"Release Candid Hate"</a>.</p>
<p>This new EP, released in August 2013, marks the first time kokori does an heavy bet on vocals and lyrics, and is released in vinyl, with a two discs special edition for those who want all the bits.</p>
<p>In 2014 kokori released a single, "Desert Moon / First Egg", in a limited edition 7" vinyl that soon sold out. But they were far from done yet, and preparing more material for...</p>
<p><strong>Rootkit</strong>, kokori's full album, that was released in January 2016, and <a href="https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/27295098">re-released in CD format</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>A new album will be released in 2025, a split with Floating Ashes, and the debut of a series of records by ANTI-DEMOS-CRACIA.</p>
